## About

The purpose of this blog is to have an archive of topics in Physics & Mathematics that I will be learning along the years.  Some say that the best way to learn is to teach, I also share that vision. Although I am not a professor I always write in the spirit of teaching to someone else just in case someone find this webpage on the internet. The followimg quote by Mark Twain captures the essence of this blog and my writing style

> *“Write what you know.”*

> Mark Twain.

I also post some of my work here.

## About me

My name is Isai E. Dávila Cuba, I am a peruvian physicist and I am currently a High Energy Physics [Diploma](https://diploma.ictp.it/) student at ICTP in Trieste, Italy. I graduated in Physics in 2022 from the National University of La Plata in Argentina under the supervision of Diego Correa. For my thesis I study vortices in the abelian Higgs model.

I will start my PhD at [SISSA](https://www.statphys.sissa.it/wordpress/) in October 2023. My current research interest are Conformal field theories, the renormalization group, critical phenomena, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, entanglement entropy and the relations between all these subjects. 

My favourite scientific quote is the following:

> *"I remember telling someone that I wanted to learn about elementary particles by studying boiling water."*
>
> Alexander Polyakov.
