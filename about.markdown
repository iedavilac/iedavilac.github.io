## About

The purpose of this blog is to have an archive of topics in Physics, Mathematics, Language learning and History that I will be learning along the years.  Some say that the best way to learn is to teach, I also share that vision. Although I am not a professor I always write in the spirit of teaching to someone else just in case someone find this webpage on the internet. The followimg quote by Mark Twain captures the essence of this blog and my writing style

> *“Write what you know.”*

I also post some of my work here.

## About me

My name is Isai E. Dávila Cuba, and I am a physicist and currently a High Energy Physics student at ICTP in Trieste, Italy. My current academic interests are the study of topological solitons in the Chern-Simons-Higgs theory, mathematical aspects of String Theory and QFT. In recent times I have found a very keen interest in pure mathematics, and I started reading standard math books in order to someday apply this knowledge to physics problems.

Since this is my personal webpage, I will also list my non-academic interests: language learning (currently japanese and italian), history and programming (specially programming related to game making).
